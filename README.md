# BudgetBuddy
This is my final project that I chose to create in c++ in school. We did not touch on the object oriented portion of C++. This is my first computer language and first real programming experience. This project specifically was something I created completely from scratch with no prompts. 

For private use only please. Not for resale.

So BudgetBuddy is a budget creator and calculator.
